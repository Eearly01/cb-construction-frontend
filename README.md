## Approach taken

- we started by making a model with the 2 felids that are the main data we need. then went through and made it meet mvp. we then started to add things to it like user authentication and able to log more thing than just the silt fence stuff.

## Notes for latter

- we want to add things to the input form for other jobs on the site like street sweepings, machinery used, and people that worked on the job.

## User stories

- As a user I should be able to enter the footage used on the job.

- As a user I should be able to log the job site name.

- As a user i should be able to see cards of what i have made
